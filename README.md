# hello-world

Hi aficionados.
This is my practice of editions on the Hello world exercise.
Regarding my self, I am currently located at Guayaquil. Today is a hot day. Lots of humidity also. So I have a big fan, close to me. It helps a lot when the day is hot. 
I also have an ac equipment. Only the fan is considered more ecologic friendly and also the electric bills are lower.
